# GEE NDVI and LST Compositing Scripts

## Overview

These Google Earth Engine (GEE) scripts utilize surface reflectance data from **Landsat 7 ETM+** (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) and **Landsat 8 OLI** (Operational Land Imager) to generate a series of NDVI images for a defined time period and study area. In addition, surface temperature data from **Landsat 8 TIRS** (Thermal Infrared Sensor) is used to produce composite Land Surface Temperature (LST) images over the same temporal and spatial extent.

The case study focuses on **Cuyahoga County, Ohio**. NDVI composites are based on growing season imagery from **April to October (2016â€“2018)** to align with **2017 high-resolution land cover data** from the Cuyahoga County Planning Commission. LST composites use imagery from **May to September** during the same time period.

## Preprocessing Notes

To enhance compatibility between Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 datasets, band-level transformations from Roy et al. (2016) were applied to Landsat 7 surface reflectance data:

## Usage

These scripts must be run within the **Google Earth Engine Code Editor** to access Earth Engine-hosted assets.

When exporting images, it is recommended to use a **UTM Zone 17N projection** or **EPSG:4326** for consistency with other spatial data.
